### Quality Status

| Gate | Status | Value |
|------|--------|-------|
| Tests | ✅ | 983 passed, 2 skipped |
| Coverage | ❌ | **78%** (below 80% threshold) |
| Lint | ❌ | 44 errors (19 auto-fixable) |

### Team Performance (from metrics)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Phases Completed | 0 (metrics not recording) |
| Average Coverage | 78% |
| Coffee Breaks (collaboration) | 0 |
| Top Performer | N/A |

### Action Items for Human

- [ ] **Check on spawned coders** - 3 were assigned but haven't reported back
- [ ] **Fix linting** - Run `.venv/bin/ruff check --fix` for 19 auto-fixable errors
- [ ] **Investigate metrics** - Agent tracking system not recording data
- [ ] **Coverage still at 78%** - Need 80% minimum

## Detailed Findings

### Coverage Status Update

The overall coverage remains at **78%**, still below the required 80% threshold. While Ada successfully delivered Phase 4.2 with excellent test coverage (92-93%), critical gaps remain in the orchestrator modules.

**Critical Orchestrator Gaps (Previously Assigned):**
1. `orchestrator/requirements_compliance.py` - 0% coverage
2. `orchestrator/agent_spawner.py` - 17% coverage
3. `orchestrator/dashboard.py` - 24% coverage
4. `orchestrator/orchestrator.py` - 27% coverage
5. `orchestrator/agent_runner.py` - 41% coverage

**Note:** Phoenix previously spawned 3 coders to address the top 3 gaps, but no completion has been reported.

### Code Quality Issues

**Linting:** 44 errors detected
- 19 can be auto-fixed with `--fix`
- Recommend immediate cleanup

**Type Checking:** 53 errors across 14 files
- Most concentrated in `orchestrator/dashboard.py`
- Missing return type annotations

### Positive Highlights

- **Ada's Phase 4.2 Success:** Delivered TWO high-quality parallel scheduler implementations
  - ThreadPoolExecutor version: 14 tests, 92% coverage
  - Asyncio alternative: 26 tests, 93% coverage
- **Infrastructure Improvements:** Coffee break system and metrics tracking added
- **Test Growth:** Tests increased from 874 to 983 (109 new tests added)

## Technical Debt

Per `docs/technical-debt.md`, the following items remain open:
- **TD-5.1:** NATS Bus at 54% coverage (target 80%)
- **TD-5.2:** Coordination at 44% coverage (target 80%)
- **TD-1.3:** Task Decomposer at 74% coverage (target 80%)
- **TD-ORCH:** Critical orchestrator gaps (coders assigned but no updates)
