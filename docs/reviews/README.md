# Review Reports

This directory contains requirements review reports generated by the Requirements Reviewer Agent.

## Purpose

Review reports validate that implementations:

- Meet all requirements from the roadmap
- Pass all quality gates
- Follow project conventions
- Are well-tested and documented

## Report Format

Each review report includes:

1. **Executive Summary** - Quick overview of findings
2. **Requirements Compliance** - What was met/unmet
3. **Quality Gates** - Test/lint/type check results
4. **Findings** - Issues organized by severity (Critical 🔴, Major 🟠, Minor 🟡, Observations 🔵)
5. **Code Quality Assessment** - Scored evaluation
6. **Recommendations** - Actionable next steps
7. **Test Results** - Full test output
8. **Sign-off** - Final approval status

## Severity Levels

- **🔴 Critical** - Must fix before merge (breaking issues, missing requirements)
- **🟠 Major** - Should fix before merge (important gaps, poor practices)
- **🟡 Minor** - Nice to fix (improvements, edge cases)
- **🔵 Observation** - Informational (good practices, alternatives)

## Review Status

- **✅ APPROVED** - Ready to merge
- **⚠️ APPROVED WITH MINOR ISSUES** - Can merge with minor improvements noted
- **❌ CHANGES REQUIRED** - Must address critical/major issues before merge

## File Naming

Reports are named after the work stream they review:

```
phase-1-1-core-data-models.md
phase-1-2-task-parser.md
phase-2-1-team-composition.md
```

## Usage

### For Implementers

After completing a work stream, check for a review report:

```bash
ls docs/reviews/phase-*.md
cat docs/reviews/phase-1-1-core-data-models.md
```

If changes are required, address the findings and request re-review.

### For Reviewers

Generate a review report following the "Deep Code Review" workflow in [`.claude/agents/qa_agent.md`](../../.claude/agents/qa_agent.md).
