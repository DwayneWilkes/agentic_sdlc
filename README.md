# Agentic SDLC - Orchestrator Agent

An autonomous orchestrator agent system that decomposes complex tasks, designs specialized subagent teams, and coordinates parallel execution with recursive self-improvement.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/
```

## What is This?

The Orchestrator Agent is a meta-agent system for general problem-solving. Give it a task, and it will:

1. Analyze and decompose the task
2. Design the right team of specialized agents
3. Execute subtasks in parallel
4. Integrate results into a final solution
5. Learn and improve from each execution

## Current Status

**Phase 1.1: Foundation** - Setting up project structure and core data models

See [plans/roadmap.md](plans/roadmap.md) for details.

## Architecture

The orchestrator follows a modular design with 15 core capability areas:

- Task Analysis & Decomposition
- Team Design & Agent Selection
- Task Assignment & Parallelization
- Coordination & Communication
- Monitoring & Progress Tracking
- Error Handling & Resilience
- Integration & Synthesis
- Self-Improvement & Meta-Learning
- And more...
